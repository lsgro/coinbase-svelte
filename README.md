# Svelte toy-app

This project is a first attempt at using [Svelte](http://svelte.dev) coding in TypeScript to stream market data provided by a public WebSocket connection.

It depends on the sibling project [coinbase-ts](https://github.com/lsgro/coinbase-ts). Pull both in the same directory to compile.
